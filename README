My solutions to programming problems, including:
- Project Euler problems (http://projecteuler.net)
- UVa Online Judge (http://uva.onlinejudge.org)
- Spoj - Sphere online judge (http://www.spoj.pl)

Please keep in mind that these are expected to be low quality code.
Don't try this at home!

All code is copyleft, but please don't copy. You should solve the problems by yourself.
