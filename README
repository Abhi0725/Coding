My solutions to programming problems, including:
- Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net)
- UVa Online Judge (http://uva.onlinejudge.org)
- Spoj - Sphere online judge (http://www.spoj.pl)

Please keep in mind that these are expected to be low quality code.
Don't try this at home!

All code is copyleft, but please don't copy: you should solve the problems by yourself (you should not even look at a solution before solving the problem).
